## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Doker
TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
I will program a discord bot that will allow you to play poker in a server with your friends
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
It will DM players their hand and keep track of everyones hands when the flop comes out. It will have check, bet, raise, and folding programmed in. It will specify hands as pairs, trips, quads, straights, flushes, etc.
TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
Analyzing hands and labeling your poker hand.
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Programming checking, betting, folding, sidepot.
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Keeping track of chips.
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
The first big skill I will need to acquire would be learning how to program a discord bot. I will also need to look for inspiration because poker is an incredibly complex game and has many many moving parts and values to keep to memory. First I think I will tackle the server aspect of the bot and just start off allowing players to join games. Then I will have to tackle likely the hardest part, calculating poker hands. Lastly I will implement keeping track of chips and maybe even sidepot.
